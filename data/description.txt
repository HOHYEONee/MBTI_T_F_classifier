For the final program execution, we used `final_data`. When `initial_data` was used, there were many errors during program execution. This seemed to be because we only created positive and declarative sentences when generating sentences using specific keywords. To address this, we incorporated various sentence structures, including positive sentences, negative sentences, declarative sentences, and interrogative sentences. Additionally, we set up various scenarios to create a wide range of sentences that could be used in related contexts. As a result, we were able to complete `final_data`.

When collecting data, we manually created sentences by researching sentences from MBTI test websites and MBTI-related books. Additionally, we increased the number of sentences using methods such as synonym replacement, back translation, and text generation model, etc.
